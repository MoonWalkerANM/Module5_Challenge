Capomulin is better than Infubinol and Ceftamin since the final tumor volume rage is smaller than the latters when comparing the box plot for the treatment groups - Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin and as good as Ramicane.
The strong correlation can be seen between the mouse weight vs. the average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen by looking at the scatter plot.
The response of the treatment for the mouse id l509 shows that the best result can be seen around 35 days with the smallest tumor volume and the size increased again.
